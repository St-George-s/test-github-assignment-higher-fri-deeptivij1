Task 1: software design and development


PART A 
1a:

2 assumptions about the data in the text file 
- Date is in the correct format 
- Age is an integer

1b: 

Design technique to convert to upper case strings
def convert_strings(inputted_word):
    if inputted_word[0] != inputted_word[0].upper():
        inputted_word = inputted_word[0].upper() + inputted_word[1:]

    return inputted_word

PART B
1c: code written on answers.py

1d: 

How watchpoint could be used to test these sightings are counted correctly
A watchpoint for the variable count could be tracked and the code can stop when it reaches 6
when dayToCount becomes 02/09/21

1e:

Evaluate efficiency of function that changed first character of input to upper-case
- Efficient because it allows you to use the same function for mammal and town 
- Efficient because the first letter is only changed if the first character is lowercase, otherwise it's returned immediately

Evaluate maintainability of your program, referring to modularity
- Maintainable because you can edit each sub-routine individually without impacting others 
- Local variables can be edited within each sub-routine without it affecting the main program
